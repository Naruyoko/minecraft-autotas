# minecraft-autotas

Tools for using programs to TAS Minecraft parkours.

A TAS for Minecraft can have varying goals. Some aim for completing the game with glitches, which allows abusing absurd strategies to [beat the game in 20 seconds](https://youtu.be/do08uW0N5Qs). Others completes much more extensive goal, such as [slaining all bosses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTnjG_929jM), [completing all advancements](https://youtu.be/f1bIwF0xPDI), or [just having fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SabNImEKUS8). These need meticulous planning and strategizing. [More info on Minecraft TASing](https://minecrafttas.com/).

There is a category of Minecraft TASes which aims to complete a map as fast as possible. I think there are 2 kinds of maps, adventure maps and parkour maps, in which the time relies heavily on having an optimized movement. Minecraft, however, like any other games with 3D physics engine, is a complicated game to know the optimal movement. These tools aim to provide the level of optimization that no manual solutions could reach.
